							<br>For the past 15 years I have been in the hospitality industry managing pubs clubs and restaurants around QLD and the NT.

									<h2>My interest in IT</h2>
									<p>What drew me to IT initially was gaming related, ever since I was a child I have been on computers, consoles, basically anything with a screen.
										<br>As I am getting older, I find myself drawn to how these things work rather than just using them. 
										<br>though I have had no experience in the IT industry it is something I would like to do</p>

									<h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
									<p>I decided to study with RMIT for a couple of reasons. 
									<br>Coming from a smaller town in QLD the local university does not offer IT courses so I had to source elsewhere,
									<br>I found that RMIT gave me the best chance to learn as much as I could in a flexible way as I often work night shifts in hospitality. 
									<br>This does not give me a lot of time during the day as I and up most the night so “conventional” university studies would not suit my schedule very well, 
									<br>for this I’m am glad to have found RMIT.</p>

									<h2>What i hope to gain</h2>
									<p>I am hoping to learn as much as I can during my studies, 
									<br>there Isn't anything I can think of that will not help me in the future. 
									<br>Though I would really like to dive into the making of software and everything that comes with it. 
									<br>I hope to, in the future I hope to move on to game development because that is where my passion lies. 
									<br>I know this will be a long journey as I know little about the subject, but I am learning more every day.</p>

									<h2>what these tests mean</h2>
									<p>These test results only reinforce what I already know about myself, but it is interesting to see how accurate they can be.
									This is also very good information for prospective employers to have so they can build a team that not only works well 
									but have different points of view.
								<br>
								<br>I don’t think knowing these results would change my behavior in a team at all, 
									I believe I would act the same way in a team environment whether I knew the results or not. 
									It is nice however that other people may see them so that they may know what to expect.
								<br>
								<br>
									Knowing the type of personalities of your potential team members before choosing your team can be 
									very beneficial, this will allow you to choose team members who will work well together based on their 
									personalities to alleviate any tension or clashing between people before the team has even been chosen 
									making the team environment much smoother.</p>

							<h2>My project</h2>
							<p>	I would like to create a side scrolling platform game that will be designed based on classics like “Mario Bros” 
								created through the unity platform and marketed through the app store for free. I believe creating a game like this 
								will prove as a great steppingstone for my ideal job by giving me necessary experience in the unity platform and help 
								to understand and learn the steps and skills required to develop a game and work within a development team.
							</p>
							<p>	Platform games are very flexible as to the devices they can be played on (e.g. mobile, platform, pc) which makes them 
								incredibly accessible. They are great “entry level” games for anyone who may want to pick up and play them as the rules 
								of the game are simple and easy to understand. The control scheme is also easy to understand and simple to use, 
								Allowing any skill level from seasoned gamer to complete beginner to pick up and play on any device they are comfortable 
								with.
							</P>
							<p>	The aim of this game will be simple, the player needs to make it to the end of the stage travelling left to right while 
								performing tasks, collecting items and killing/destroying/avoiding enemies. Deaths will return the player to a checkpoint, 
								which is either the beginning of a stage, A specific point that was previously reached or a whenever a specific task has been 
								completed. The player will have a limited amount of “lives” or “retries” depending on what previous milestones have been reached 
								or tasks completed. Upon running out of “lives” or “retries” the player will need to start from the beginning of the highest 
								stage previously reached. All checkpoints throughout the stage will be reset and will need to be achieved again to be used.
							</p>
							<p>	I believe using a color pallet and art style that is bright, bubbly and fun will allow this game to reach more of the market 
								as using things like blood, gore, and horror themes will deter some age groups (especially children) from picking it up and playing 
								it. This will make sure that there is no age constraints of potential players when wanting to play this game and will be safe for gamers 
								of all ages.
							</p>
							<p>	Upon opening the game for the first time the player will have to start from stage 1. After the player has completed a stage they can choose 
								to go back and retry the stage completed or continue to a new stage (usually more difficult).
							</p>
							<p>	There will be multiple ways a player can lose a “life or a “retry”. Touching an enemy or any projectiles an enemy may shoot will result in a 
								death which will return the player to a checkpoint. Falling off the base platform will also result in a death returning the player to a checkpoint. 
								Running out of time on a stage will also result in a death returning the player to a checkpoint.
							</p>
							<p>	Upon completing a stage, A “victory screen” will be shown highlighting any milestones reached, items collected, the total time it took the player to 
								complete the stage and also how many “retries” were used on the stage that was completed.
							</p>
							<p>	The making of this game will not require much hardware to do so as much of the work will be done through the unity engine itself. Needing only a laptop 
								with the unity engine installed and somewhere to market the game (a place for potential players to download the game). This game can be made with a small 
								team of people who are familiar with the unity engine and platform games in general and who also have a love for the gaming industry.
							</p>
							<p>	If this project were successful I believe it would be not only great experience for game development in general it would also have the opportunity 
								to be marketed as a game that could be sought after for advertisement if it was deemed worthy of being monetized so in future job opportunities I could 
								call on what I learned making this game to give myself a better chance in  gaining employment with a game development company.
